            Mission Statement
        </h2>

        <p>
            Our mission is to maximize opportunities for children through educational innovations that will
            ensure their full development as healthy and positive contributors to the greater community.
        </p>
        <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
        <p>

            The school’s vision will meet the distinct needs of our newly arrived student population.
            Rochester Math and Science Academy (RMSA) will create a supportive family teaching community
            that utilizes shared ideals, goals and experiences as a major tool for fostering a comprehensive and challenging education.
            Our vision is to meet the distinct needs of Rochester’s diverse student population.
            We will use projects and mentorships to integrate learning, encourage daily reading and writing,
            and motivate academic achievement. Rochester Math and Science Academy will place the student at the
            center of a diverse and mutually respectful educational community of teachers, parents,
            inter-generational community volunteers, and experienced teachers who will all act as
            guidance counselors and student advocates. We will encourage and assist parents
            and other adults to reinforce student academic performance through extensive student writing and
            reading. We will work to foster character, initiative, leadership, problem solving, critical thinking,
            teamwork, and communication as well as academic skills in math/science/technology, the humanities, and communication.
